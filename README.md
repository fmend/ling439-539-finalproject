# ling439-539-finalproject
Final Project for LING 439/539

My final project uses logistic regression as a baseline model with standard word tokenization and unigram features.
I implement several other word tokenizers, as well as TF-IDF weighting to generate twelve total models. 
Additionally, I implement GloVe embeddings as a more sophisticated model, total of 13 models.
I measure each for accuracy.
